## What each folder contains

- The folder UI-UX contain 90% of the design of the application who will available at the end.
- The folder ReactSPA contains the code of the Web Application **estenligne** writed in React.Js
- The folder estenligne is empty folder where the final version will be move to add it into the original branch of the project.

## What works actually and how to acess/test them

Currently You can register and singup. You can also simulated the sending of an message but the receiver will never receive it because this function only work in local.

To test the project dowload the folder ReactSPA and open the command line in the root of the project and do:


```Bash
npm start
```

You will get something like **localhost:3000** in the command line. Type it into your browser if website it does not open itself automaticaly in your default browser.  

complete the route(**localhost:3000**) with each of the next endpoint to see the corresponding page.

1. /login
2. /home
3. /register
4. /resetpassword
5. /newpassword

***Due to some issues with the api the application has not been end on time. But, maybe in the future the stable and full version can be available***
